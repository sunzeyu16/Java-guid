		Authors and actors and artists and such.<br/>
		Never know nothing, and never know much.<br/>
		Sculptors and singers and those of their kidney<br/>
		Tell their affairs from Seattle to Sydney.

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Playwrights and poets and such horses' necks<br/>
		Start off from anywhere, end up at sex.<br/>
		Diarists, critics, and similar roe<br/>
		Never say nothing, and never say no.

		People Who Do Things exceed myh endurance;<br/>
		God, for a man that solicits insurance!
